                <p>
                Over the summers of 2019 and 2020 I've worked at Ithaca College's <a href="https://dougturnbull.org/index.php/jimilab/">Jimilab</a> researching machine learning. The team has been developing a web-app called <a href="https://localify.org">Localify</a> which generates playlists with local artists and recommends upcoming concerts in the area based on their spotify listening history.
                </p>
                <p>
                Localify uses <i>Collaborative filtering (CF)</i> to generate playlists. This is quite difficult with local artists, as CF requires a large amount of user listening data. This data is very sparse for obscure local artists. To get around this issue, we have been researching the viability of using <i>Content-based (CB)</i> recommendation. With CB, we recommend songs based on how they sound compared to songs we know the user likes. This doesn't have a bias towards the number of listens a song has, and is ideally a more fair, merit-based way of recommending music.
                </p>
                <p>
                In pursuit of this, we developed some initial experiments using <i>Triplet Networks</i>. Triplet Networks are good at creating simple representations of data which are easy to compare. You can read the fine details in our paper which my professor Doug Turnbull and I had the pleasure of presenting at Machine Learning for Music Discovery (ML4MD) 2020, an International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) workshop.
