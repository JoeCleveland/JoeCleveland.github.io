        <h2>JimiLab - Music Tech projects</h2>
        <p>
            During my two final years of undergrad, I worked at Ithaca College's music innovation lab: JimiLab.<br>
            I worked in a number of areas related to music technology and machine learning, including recommender
            systems, generative models, and DSP.<br>
            You can view the details of these projects here:<br><br>
            <a href="projects/audiosim.html">Content-based Music Similarity with Triplet Networks</a><br>
            <a href="projects/nsm.html">Synthesis with Generative Models</a><br>
            <a href="projects/synthplugin.html">VST Plugin - Delay-line based synthesizer</a><br><br>
            My first summer at JimiLab, in collaboration with Arshiya Gupta, we embarked on a project to estimate
            synthesizer settings from audio. The idea being that one could feed in a sample from their favorite
            synth-pop song, and
            automatically setup their synthesizer so that they could play along.
            We ran many experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks, among other ML architectures, to predict
            parameters
            used to generate samples from
            many different synthesizer types, spanning FM, Additive, Subtractive, and Physical Models. Along the way we
            implemented an FM and Karplus-Strong synthesizer to
            generate training data.
            Although we did not have great results with our estimator, this project gave me a really solid foundation in
            machine learning and DSP, which
            contributed to greater success with the projects listed above the following year.<br><br>

        <h2>Other Programming Projects - School & Professional</h2>

        <a href="https://github.com/JoeCleveland/simple-compiler">My Compiler</a> is the product of an independent study
        in compiler design at Ithaca College.
        Implemented in C++, it takes a C-like language and compiles it down to x86 Assembly in the MacOS MACH_O format.
        This project gave me experience with every piece of the compiler pipeline, from designing a valid Backus-Naur
        grammar, to lexical analysis,
        to recursive-descent parsing, to intermediate language generation, to valid machine code generation.<br><br>

        <a href="https://gorges.us/cases/clean-air-construction-the-yard/">Clean Air Construction - Portland</a> (VueJS,
        PHP, MySQL) As a software developer at GORGES Inc, I worked as the
        technical lead to implement the city of Portland Oregon's construction diesel emissions compliance software. We
        successfully launched last year and have thousands of active users.
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://gorges.us/cases/willet-dairy/">Willet Dairy</a>(VueJS, Firebase) - Also at GORGES Inc, I was
        the sole developer and project manager
        for a mobile application which tracks the activity on dairy farms to compute expenditures and provide a
        per-field and per-crop analysis of profit.

        <h2>Music Projects</h2>

        <a href="https://josephcleveland.bandcamp.com/album/il-soffito-di-patrizia">Il Soffitto di Patrizia</a> is a
        full album of original music I composed in 2020, making use of euro-rack, sampling, and live drums. <br><br>

        I also composed a retro-wave style score for an 80's themed short film project: <a
