                This summer I have been working on a couple projects exploring machine learning for music and audio. I've written up the details of these projects here:<br>
                <a href="projects/audiosim.html">Audio Similarity with Triplet Networks</a><br>
                <a href="projects/nsm.html">Neural Synthesis Models</a><br>
                <br>
                And I have also been working on a plugin in C++ with the JUCE framework:<br> 
                <a href="projects/synthplugin.html">Synthesizer Plugin for Abelton/Logic/Pro Tools</a><br><br>
                As a student at Ithaca College I worked on a number of other software projects:<br><br>
                <a href="https://github.com/DubThink/Guessong">Guessong</a> is a multiplayer web game I contributed to. Random songs are played and users must guess the name of the song before the other players! We wrote the backend in Python/Flask and used JQuery and Bootstrap on the frontend. Realtime client-server communication was handled with SocketIO. The audio for the songs was retrieved using the ItunesAPI. <br><br>
                
                <a href="https://github.com/JoeCleveland/simple-compiler">My Compiler</a> is a project I started in the summer of 2018 and got academic credit for the following semester. I implemented most of the features for a compiler for a simple C-like language. This was a huge undertaking but I learned a lot and it was really fun.<br><br>

                The code for all these projects and a few others is available on  <a href="https://github.com/JoeCleveland">my Github profile</a>
